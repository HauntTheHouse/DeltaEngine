# Delta Engine

The engine system is inspired by [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) Game Engine series.

The math library was implemented according to the book ["Game Physics: In One Weekend"](https://gamephysicsweekend.github.io/).\
I will also try to implement the physical engine based on this book.

In progress from now to forever.
