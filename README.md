# Delta Engine
My attempt to create a game physics engine following the book ["Game Physics: In One Weekend"](https://gamephysicsweekend.github.io/).

Graphics engine is being created according to the Game Engine series by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno), [SimpleCoding](https://www.youtube.com/@SimpleCodingChannel) and my preferences.

In progress.
